    description:
      "CargoFlow is a web app designed to optimize loading and unloading cargo ships at ports. Using A* and Greedy Best First Search algorithms, it generates efficient operation lists for crane operators, reducing task time by 30%. I also integrated IndexedDB to ensure real-time storage and seamless recovery of ship manifests and transfer logs.",
