    title: "CargoFlow: Efficient Ship Cargo Management",
    description:
      "CargoFlow was a collaborative project where I helped develop a web app using Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS to streamline cargo management. We utilized A* and Greedy Best First Search algorithms to optimize cargo rebalancing, reducing operational time by 30% and improving efficiency. I also integrated IndexedDB for real-time data storage, ensuring seamless recovery and persistence of manifests, instructions, and logs.",

    title: "Mock Anti-Drone Missile Defense System",
    description:
      "The Mock Anti-Drone Missile Defense System was a collaborative project where I worked with a team to develop a real-time target tracking system. We integrated Python, C++, and OpenCV with Ultralytics YOLO to detect and track moving targets, while designing a servo-powered gimbal system controlled by Arduino. This project applied kinematic principles to align the missile system with precise target movement, demonstrating both software and hardware integration.",

    description:
      "The UCR Star Wars Website was a collaborative project where I worked with a team of 10 using agile/scrum methodologies. We developed the site with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Node.js, and collaborated closely with UI/UX designers to turn Figma designs into reusable modular components, improving code maintainability and cutting front-end development time by 20%. I also integrated the ShadCN React Calendar and Google Calendar API, allowing the website to dynamically display club events, boosting user engagement by 30%.",
